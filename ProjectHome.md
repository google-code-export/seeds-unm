# How To Use This Webpage: #


**Downloads**

This is the place to keep attachable documents. Just remember -- only upload things that are legal (e.g. public domain, or you own copy right).

**Wiki**

The Wiki is the place to store online documents such as agendas, notes, ideas, and links. Feel free to create new pages and edit existing pages. If you want, you can add your name or initials to comments. Please be courteous about modifying other people's work. When you edit a page, any changes are tracked by the system, so nothing is ever really erased.

See the "Wiki markup help" link (upper right) for advice about formatting pages. Or go here: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax

**Issues**

I propose we use this as a to-do list. This allows us to see everything that's been done and needs to be done.
The quickest way to communicate is to add email addresses into the CC box. This will get forwarded directly to our email.

**How to make a new issue**

  * Click new issue, add a short, descriptive title, and a description of the task.
  * Set the status to **New**
  * Please add the relevant label, such as "PR," "Outreach," or "Grant."
  * Set an appropriate priority label if you want.

**How to use existing issues**

  * Anyone can add their username to the CC box of an issue to follow it.
  * Feel free to add comments to issues.
  * Once an issue is completed, please change the status to **Done**.
  * Notice - you can search for issues that you own, follow, etc.
