Update sent May 16th, 2012:

"Hello SEEDS Members!

I wanted to take a moment and update everyone on the happenings of the past month, it sure has been a busy one. All of the UNM SEEDS officers have been hard at work establishing the chapter, acting on funding oportunities and looking into other opportunities and projects.

So what has changed in the past month?


At our first meeting we elected the following individuals for our executive board:
  * Presidents: Michelle Nuanez: mnuanez6137@gmail.com,
> > Adeline Murthy: amurthy@unm.edu
  * Vice President: Lizzy Stone  lizzylauriel@gmail.com
  * Secretary: Ann Swift swifta12@unm.edu
  * Treasurer: Ben Wright iveerleft@gmail.com
  * Outreach Director: Jesse Trujillo  trujillo.jessedavid@gmail.com
  * Public Relations Officer: Leonardo Gutierrez leonardogutierrez@gmail.com

Adeline will be studying abroad until January, thus the need for 2 presidents for this year. She will be as active as possible and will participate remotely until her return. Have a great time Adeline, we will see you again soon!

Congratulations to all the officers on their appointments! Shannon McCoy-Hayes has also graciously agreed to be a staff advisor, her expertise in many fields and connections have already proved invaluable. Thank you Shannon for all your help and continued support. Dr. Scott Collins has agreed to be our Faculty Advisor and also PI for projects. Thank you Dr. Collins for your enthusiastic support of UNM SEEDS!



·UNM SEEDS has now officially been chartered with ASUNM. This will provide the backing of the University for things like funding, facilities and equipment usage and has other benefits as well.

·We have applied for our first grant! This past Monday, UNM SEEDS treasurer Ben Wright sent in our first proposal for funding through the Ted Turner ranches. Our proposal included a proposal to research the effects of bison grazing in arid landscapes and encompasses outreach to high school and middle school students. The full application is available to all SEEDS members upon request.

·Many of you got together at Marble Brewery to celebrate the end of the semester and start of summer. Congratulations to everyone who graduated and happy summer “break” to those who are still working toward that!



Looking ahead I know we all have high hopes and see great promise for UNM SEEDS. Several projects are already in the work for UNM SEEDS. Here’s what’s on the horizon:

·UNM SEEDS constitution and bylaws is in the works. I would love input from anyone and everyone. This will need to be finalized ASAP and voted into adoption. All members will have a vote, so please participate! Document attached to this email.

·We are in the process of applying for the NM Game and Fish Share with Wildlife grant. The project selected will likely be similar to the Turner Ranch proposal, however we do have room to change things up, so if you have any input please contact myself or Ben Wright ASAP.

·ESA Conference!!! The Ecological Society of America, whom SEEDS is under, is holding their annual meeting and conference August 5-10 in Portland, OR. We will be sending the executive board to participate. If you are interested in going, please let me know ASAP. More information to come.

·SEEDS is hosting a trip to the Cedar Creek LTER Sept 20-23. Applications are due May 22. Visit http://www.esa.org/seeds/programs/fieldtrips/upcoming.php for more info.

·We need members!!! If you know anyone interested in ecology at UNM ask them to join UNM SEEDS!! UNM SEEDS is open to all students (graduate/undergrads/non degree). In addition to getting on the mailing list, it is VERY important that you go to UNM Student Activities Center website and register to be a member of UNM SEEDS. It is this roster that ASUNM will use to determine funding… the more members èThe more funding è the more $ we have for fun things…so please do this!

·Next general meeting TBA. General meetings during the summer will be minimal since many members and officers will be out of town and/or busy with field work. We will be resuming monthly meetings in August.



Thank you everyone for your passion and dedication to the ecological community. Adeline and myself will be sending these updates monthly to keep everyone in the loop. If you have any ideas, concerns or want to be involved in any aspect of UNM SEEDS please feel free to contact myself or any of the officers. I hope everyone has a great summer!
